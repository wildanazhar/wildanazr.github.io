  <pre style="font-family: Arial;">
  Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, 
  About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of 
  continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes and earthquakes. 
                    
  Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.Earth's atmosphere consists 
  mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. 
  Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature.

  A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. 
  Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

<pre style="font-family: arial;">
  The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), 
  it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of a major planet,[f] the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, 
  and larger than any known dwarf planet.

  The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.
  It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's

<pre style="font-family: arial;">
  Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. 
  In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".

  The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance, 
  that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, 
  with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon, and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <img class="w3-animate-zoom" src="saturn.png" alt="Artis Korea" style="width: 36%">
<pre style="font-family: arial;">
  Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about 
  nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, 
  Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

  Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, 
  where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like 
  a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.
